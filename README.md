###  Hello! âœ¨

My name is Rodrigo Fernandes GonÃ§alves[^1]. I just finished my master's in Economics at the University of BrasÃ­lia. For 6 years, I've been studying environmental economics ðŸŒ±. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in environmental public policy evaluation, environmental impact on health, degrowth, and econometrics. 

I'm a marxist, being influenced by authors such as Marx, Kalecki and Lenin. More recently authors such as John Foster, Sabrina Fernandes, Saad-Filho, David Graeber and Kohei Saito have shaped my views.
