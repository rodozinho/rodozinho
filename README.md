###  Hello! âœ¨

My name is Rodrigo Fernandes GonÃ§alves. I just finished my master's in Economics at the University of BrasÃ­lia. For 6 years, I've been studying environmental economics ðŸŒ±. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in environmental public policy evaluation, environmental impact on health, degrowth, and econometrics.
