###  Hello!
- Pronouns: He/him

My name is Rodrigo Fernandes[^1]. I'm a first-year PhD student at Uni of Bonn. For 6 years, I've been studying environmental economics ðŸŒ±. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in environmental public policy evaluation, environmental impact on health, degrowth, and econometrics. 

I'm a Marxist, being influenced by authors such as Marx (obviously), Kalecki, Rosa and Lenin. More recently authors such as John Bellamy Foster, Sabrina Fernandes, Saad-Filho, David Graeber and Kohei Saito have shaped my views.

- Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Github! Next steps:
  - [ X ] Understand how to use Git and GitKraken (at least vaguely)
  - [ ] Create a website <!--https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7-->
  - [ ] Finish to upload my codes

Feel free to contact me here if you wish!

[^1]: That's not me in the picture, unfortunately. It's the ~~only~~ greatest economist Oskar Lange.
