###  Hello! ✨

My name is Rodrigo Fernandes Gonçalves[^1]. I just finished my master's in Economics at the University of Brasília. For 6 years, I've been studying environmental economics 🌱. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in environmental public policy evaluation, environmental impact on health, degrowth, and econometrics.

[^1]: That's not me on the picture, unfortunately. It's the ~~only~~ greatest economist Oskar Lange.
